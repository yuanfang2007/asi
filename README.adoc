== Make the application executable
If you are using Gradle, you can run the application using `./gradlew bootRun`.  Or you can build the JAR file using `./gradlew build`. Then you can run the JAR file:

[subs="attributes", role="has-copy-button"]
....
java -jar build/libs/gs-rest-service-0.1.0.jar
....

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.
